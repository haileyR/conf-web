               "content":"The modernization of planet Earth has led to energy evolving from a luxury, to a utility, to now a fundamental necessity for mankind.  The demand for energy to support numerous current and emerging industries continues to grow at an exponential rate.  Thus, global efforts for excavating natural fossil energy resources have been vigorous. The use of fossil energy generates greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which have been shown to contribute to global climate change.  If left unchecked they will eventually lead to the destruction of planet Earth.  Therefore, the urgency surrounding this situation is enormous.  As a result, great efforts have been made for harvesting renewable energies such as solar, wind, wave, ocean, etc.  However, the demand for energy is so great that its supply is far outpaced by the demand.  It will take many years of reducing GHG to an acceptable level, and sustaining these approaches on a long-term basis while still meeting the current demand for energy, to have a truly sustainable solution.Thus, we need to conserve energy in order for mankind to not only prolong the life of our current natural resources, but also to produce less and reduce GHG emissions overall.  We must do so until these newer energy technologies will be able to supply energy in a manner that does not continue to impact the environment. The main area of consumption of energy in the modern world is in the form of electric power.  Most industries rely on this regardless of whether the energy sources used to generate the electric power are the renewable or non-renewable.  Therefore, the scope of our research should include not only the efficiency of the power plant and their component devices to convert this electric power to useful duties, but also the efficiency of domestic appliances to minimize the consumption of this precious resource. Both issues have a critical impact on the sustainability of not just our modern conveniences, but of all mankind and human existence as we know it. This Symposium will aim to provide scientists and engineers in both the U.S. and Korea with opportunities to exchange information on the means of contributing to the solution of these important issues and to create synergies that will lead to future technological breakthroughs.",
